# Route Optimization - Multi Traveller's Salesman Problem (MTSP) Applied to Bus Routes Optimization

This project is intended to solve the MTSP using Genetic Algorithms and Multi-Objective fitness fuction. The problems
solve for the minimization of Total Route of All Buses and the minimization of the Max Route for a given bus.

## Getting Started
The project utilizes Genetic Algorithms, each solution is a set of routes for each bus.
